        <p>If you know English, then you know what are tasty cookies. But cookies have nothing to do with what I will tell you in this article.</p>

<p>Cookies are small data files that are stored on each user's device. Of course, they make our life easier, I'll tell you later why and how. But they are also a threat to your privacy.</p>

<p>If you have visited this article, then you know what a browser is. Because we will dance from this definition. So cookies are stored in a specific location on the device, namely in the browser. What is stored in them, you ask. They store information for creating contextual advertising.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Contextual advertising</strong> is a type of ads that are shown to you based on your search engine queries, based on the collected geodata (i.e. locations), based on your age and, in general, all your parameters.</blockquote></p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>When you look at web pages, a cookie agreement (for collecting your personal data) very often pops up in front of you. So that's where the magic and convenience begins. But your privacy is being violated. How it works:</p>

<p>Let's say that you chose products, searched for something on the Internet, were in some communities on social networks, on forums. And after that, ads for what you have recently searched for or visited magically appear in search engines, online stores. And it is cookies that help advertising agencies and websites to receive your user data and form a so-called "list of your preferences". After a year of using the phone, browsing websites with cookies (and not only they are responsible for this) and advertising agencies know who you are, where you study, where you work, what you are looking for, what music you like, what movies you like to watch, what books you read. Of course, it is convenient if they are used for your benefit and your life becomes easier, but the fact that this data is transmitted to third-party advertising agencies is alarming.</p>

<p>To better explain to you how cookies work, I'll give you a good example.</p>

<p>You are in the browser. Log in to your social network and do not enter your username and password, because the site remembers your data. This case is standard on the modern Internet. Yes, it's convenient. And if it weren't for cookies, this wouldn't have happened. From this comes the following definition:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Cookies</strong> are small files that are stored in the browser and in which the data that the browser exchanges with the site is placed.</blockquote></p>

<h3>The main tasks of cookies</h3>
<p>Cookies have basic tasks:</p>

<p><strong>Login to the site or authorization</strong> - you can log in to the site once in the browser and then log in to the site automatically</p>

<p><strong>Data storage</strong> - cookies will save the language, region, search queries</p>

<p><strong>Collecting information about your actions</strong> - cookies store your actions on the site and are then used in advertising</p>

<p>On the websites of private entrepreneurs, these cookies are not transferred to other companies, but in large organizations, social networks, such offenses are sometimes committed. There is a law that regulates relations with users' personal data, and since it is stored in cookies, they fall under Law No. 152-FZ "On Personal Data".</p>

<h3>Is there any way to disable them?</h3>
<p>Of course, cookies can be disabled, but this will not fix all your privacy problems. Moreover, if you disable them, then you will have to drive passwords every time you log on to the site, which may not be very convenient. To make sure that cookies will not be saved, you can use the incognito tab, where cookies, search history and all data stored in the browser are erased when such a "private" tab is closed</p>

<p>It is quite easy to disable cookies. The instructions for all browsers are almost the same:</p>

<p>You need to go to settings, find the heading "Privacy and Security" and find "Site Settings" in it and click on it. In the list that appears, select "Cookies and site data" and by clicking on the trigger, you can choose either to turn it on (if it is lit blue) or turn it off.</p>

<h3>And how do I clear cookies?</h3>
<p>All browsers do the same. You need to go to the settings and find the clear history item. Click clear and select among all "Cookies" and click either delete or clear. Now you know and understand what cookies are and can enable, disable or clear them. If you didn't find the answer to the question you were looking for, write in the comments and we will answer your question.</p>
